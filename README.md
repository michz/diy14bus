Getting started
---------------

After cloning this repository you *really* should clone our RIOT fork:
```Shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

For compiling arm based binaries you need a fully functional arm-gcc toolchain.
We use [gcc-am-embedded](https://launchpad.net/~terry.guo/+archive/ubuntu/gcc-arm-embedded).

We will think about it.
