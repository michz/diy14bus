Getting started
---------------
Please read [Erste (Repository-)Schritte](http://michz.github.io/diy14bus/2014/12/Erste-Repo-Schritte/) (german).

Short version in english:
Please make sure that you have cloned
[our RIOT fork](https://github.com/patkan/RIOT) on the same directory level.

Example:

    /home/user/home-project/diy14bus/   # this repository
    /home/user/home-project/RIOT/       # patkan/RIOT


For compiling arm based binaries you need a fully functional arm-gcc toolchain.
We use [gcc-arm-embedded](https://launchpad.net/~terry.guo/+archive/ubuntu/gcc-arm-embedded).


Compiling
---------
Go to application directory (for example `first-test/`) and run `make`.
(No need to build RIOT directly.)


License
-------
We will think about it.
